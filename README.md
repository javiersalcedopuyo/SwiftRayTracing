# Swift Ray Tracer

![Unit Testing](https://github.com/javiersalcedopuyo/SwiftRayTracing/workflows/Unit%20Testing/badge.svg)

Implementation of Peter Shirley's [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) on Swift.  
This is just a learning exercise to get familiar with the Swift language and tools.
